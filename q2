# NotebookLM Evaluation for University Use

## Overview

This repository contains structured experiments conducted to evaluate the capabilities of Google NotebookLM as an educational tool for university students. Each experiment focuses on a specific functionality of NotebookLM, with detailed results and insights documented.

### Contents
- [Contextualized Question-Answering](./Experiments/Contextualized_Question_Answering.md)
Accuracy & Effectiveness: The question-answering feature performs well in generating precise responses when the question is directly related to uploaded material with results largely depending on the quality and relevance of the input.
Strengths: Helps students engage interactively with content, enabling immediate responses to complex questions without external searching.
Weaknesses: The model may struggle with ambiguous or poorly framed questions. Hence, it providing less accurate answers in such cases.

- [Summarization](./Experiments/Summarization.md)
Accuracy & Effectiveness: This feature efficiently condenses content, allowing for effective summarization of articles or notes. Summaries generally capture key information but can occasionally overlook nuanced details.
Strengths: Saves students time by presenting distilled information, particularly useful for academic material.
Weaknesses: Some summaries might exclude critical context mostly in subjects where detailed explanations are essential.

- [Knowledge Synthesis and Explanation](./Experiments/Research_Knowledge_Synthesis_Explanation.md)
Accuracy & Effectiveness: The synthesis capabilities are effective in generating accessible explanations for complex topics which making it a valuable resource for introductory understanding.
Strengths: Helps students with foundational concepts and quick explanations and easy to understanding of difficult material.
Weaknesses: This feature can provide overly simplistic answers for advanced-level students or for content requiring deep detail and limiting its effectiveness in specialized courses.
